                        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                        <p>
                            The primary purpose of the IRG Fund is to promote and support faculty at Everest Engineering College in initiating research projects. 
                            It supports members of the faculty in establishing new research projects and taking existing research in promising new directions. 
                            The long-term aim of the IRG is to build and sustain a vibrant research culture at EEC. There are two announcement dates for the IRG 
                            applications each year: Fall and Spring. The Research Management Cell (RMC) is responsible for executing the program under the guidance 
                            of the Research Committee.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Research Definition</h3>
                        <p>
                            Research is defined as purposeful inquiry that generates new insights, knowledge, and innovation through scholarly investigation, 
                            experimentation, and scientific practices. It typically results in quantifiable outcomes and knowledge mobilization activities where 
                            research knowledge is communicated to audiences both within and beyond academia.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Activities Not Funded</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Faculty Development (training programs, thesis completion; but thesis-to-journal conversion is supported)</li>
                            <li>Institutional Research (studies limited to EEC operations)</li>
                            <li>Curriculum Development (preparation of curriculum materials and surveys not supported, unless empirical and generalizable)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
                        <p>
                            The primary applicant must be an EEC faculty member. Non-faculty members and students may join as co-applicants. 
                            The Principal Investigator (PI) manages the funds and approvals. RMC and Research Committee members may apply, 
                            but not adjudicate proposals. Applicants must have completed and reported any previous IRG projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Faculty may submit multiple proposals per window, but cannot hold two grants simultaneously as PI, unless RMC makes exceptions.
                        </p>

                        <h2>3. Application Procedure</h2>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The primary purpose of the IRG Fund is to promote and support faculty at Everest Engineering College in initiating research projects. 
        It supports members of the faculty in establishing new research projects and taking existing research in promising new directions. 
        The long-term aim of the IRG is to build and sustain a vibrant research culture at EEC. There are two announcement dates for the IRG 
        applications each year: Fall and Spring. The Research Management Cell (RMC) is responsible for executing the program under the guidance 
        of the Research Committee.
      </p>

      <h3>Research Definition</h3>
      <p>
        Research is defined as purposeful inquiry that generates new insights, knowledge, and innovation through scholarly investigation, 
        experimentation, and scientific practices. It typically results in quantifiable outcomes and knowledge mobilization activities where 
        research knowledge is communicated to audiences both within and beyond academia.
      </p>

      <h3>Activities Not Funded</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Faculty Development (training programs, thesis completion; but thesis-to-journal conversion is supported)</li>
        <li>Institutional Research (studies limited to EEC operations)</li>
        <li>Curriculum Development (preparation of curriculum materials and surveys not supported, unless empirical and generalizable)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        The primary applicant must be an EEC faculty member. Non-faculty members and students may join as co-applicants. 
        The Principal Investigator (PI) manages the funds and approvals. RMC and Research Committee members may apply, 
        but not adjudicate proposals. Applicants must have completed and reported any previous IRG projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Faculty may submit multiple proposals per window, but cannot hold two grants simultaneously as PI, unless RMC makes exceptions.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Application Procedure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>RMC calls for applications near the end of each semester.</li>
        <li>Faculty submit a research proposal containing the required sections.</li>
        <li>Applications are submitted by the PI.</li>
        <li>Proposals are reviewed by RMC and Research Committee, with external experts if needed.</li>
        <li>Proposals must meet a minimum score threshold for success.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Priority</h2>
